By default, encryption is `enabled` on all Linodes. If you opted out of encryption or if the Linode was created prior to local disk encryption support, you can encrypt your data using [Rebuild](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-rebuild-linode-instance).

You can clone your Linode's existing disks, configuration profiles and interfaces to another Linode on your account. In order for this request to complete successfully, you need the `add_linodes` grant.<br /><br />For Linodes using Linode interfaces, the clone needs to be located in a region that supports Linode interfaces (see [GET a region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-region)). The [account settings](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-account-settings) need to allow creation of Linodes with Linode interfaces.<br /><br />Cloning to a new Linode incurs a charge on your account.<br /><br />If cloning to an existing Linode, any actions currently running or queued must be completed first before you can clone to it.<br /><br />Up to five clone operations from any given source Linode can be run concurrently. If more concurrent clones are attempted, an HTTP 400 error will be returned by this operation.<br /><br />Any [tags](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-tags) existing on the source Linode will be cloned to the target Linode.<br /><br />Linodes utilizing Metadata (`"has_user_data": true`) must be cloned to a new Linode with `metadata.user_data` included with the clone request.<br /><br />`vpc` details<br /><br />- If the Linode you're cloning has a `vpc` interface on its active legacy configuration profile that includes a 1:1 NAT, the resulting clone is configured with an `any` 1:1 NAT.<br />- See the [VPC documentation](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vpc/#technical-specifications) guide for its specifications and limitations.<br /><br />`vlan` details<br /><br />- Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs.

Initiate a pending host migration that has been scheduled by Linode or initiate a cross data center (DC) migration.  A list of pending migrations, if any, can be accessed from [List notifications](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-notifications). When the migration begins, your Linode will be shutdown if not already off. If the migration initiated the shutdown, it will reboot the Linode when completed.<br /><br />To initiate a cross DC migration, you must pass a `region` parameter to the request body specifying the target data center region. You can view a list of all available regions and their feature capabilities from [List regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions). See our [Pricing Page](https://www.linode.com/pricing/) for Region-specific pricing, which applies after migration is complete. If your Linode has a DC migration already queued or you have initiated a previously scheduled migration, you will not be able to initiate a DC migration until it has completed.<br /><br />`vpc` details<br /><br />- Cross DC migrations don't work for Linodes that have a `vpc` purpose legacy configuration interface or a VPC Linode interface. They work for host migrations within the same DC.<br />- See the [VPC documentation](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vpc/#technical-specifications) guide for its specifications and limitations.<br /><br />`vlan` details:<br /><br />- Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Run the [List regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions) operation to view the capabilities of data center regions. If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.<br />- Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers do not support IPv6 `/116` pools or IP Failover. If you have these features enabled on your Linode and attempt to migrate to an NGN data center, the migration will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.<br />- See the [VLANs Overview](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications) guide to view additional specifications and limitations.<br /><br />`public` details:<br /><br />- If the Linode is using Linode interfaces, the destination region needs to also support Linode interfaces.<br />- After migrating to a different data center, Linode public interfaces retain the same number of IP addresses, but the IP addresses themselves change.<br /><br />[Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/getting-started-with-the-linode-cli)<br /><br />[Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth)

Rebuilds a Linode you have the `read_write` permission to modify.<br /><br />A rebuild first shuts down the Linode, deletes all disks and configuration profiles on the Linode, then deploys a new `image` to the Linode with the given attributes. Additionally:<br /><br />  - Requires an `image` be supplied.<br />  - Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.<br />  - It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.<br />  - Linodes utilizing Metadata (`"has_user_data": true`) should include `metadata.user_data` in the rebuild request to continue using the service.<br /><br />Linode interfaces don't change during a rebuild.<br /><br />During a rebuild, you can `enable` or `disable` local disk encryption. If disk encryption is not included in the request, the previous `disk_encryption` value is used. Disk encryption cannot be disabled if the compute instance is attached to a LKE nodepool.<br /><br />You also have the option to resize the Linode to a different plan by including the `type` parameter with your request. Note that resizing involves migrating the Linode to a new hardware host, while rebuilding without resizing maintains the same hardware host. Resizing also requires significantly more time for completion of this operation. The following additional conditions apply:<br /><br />  - The Linode must not have a pending migration.<br />  - Your Account cannot have an outstanding balance.<br />  - The Linode must not have more disk allocation than the new Type allows.<br />    - In that situation, you must first delete or resize the disk to be smaller.<br /><br />[Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/getting-started-with-the-linode-cli)<br /><br />[Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth)
